/**
 * Executes a callback only if there are no other attempts to execute another callback over a period
 * of time. If another callback is attempted to be executed, the previous one is discarded. This
 * executor is really helpful when you don't want to execute some callback too often. BUT, if a
 * callback is already being executed and a new one is posted, then the new one is ignored. In other
 * words this executor DOES NOT cancel callbacks that are already in execution progress.
